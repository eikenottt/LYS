        <strong> Lighting in a Bedroom</strong> is important to get the propper ambiance for the space. This does vary from what style people want to have,
        but there are recommendations on what colour you want on your lighting to give the room the right atmosphere.
        The prime light setting for a living room in general is:<br>
        <strong>Soft white: 2700 to 3000 kelvin.</strong> This will give the room a lighting that is more yellow than blue, giving it a more cozy look insted
        of a very clinical white/blue light.<br>
        <strong>The strength of the total lighting is recommended to 2000-4000 total lumen</strong>, depending on the size of the space.</p>

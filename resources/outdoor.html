        <strong>When lighting your garden</strong>, you dont need alot of light because your eyes need less light
        outdoors than they do indoors in order to see light, shadows and patterns.
        Outside there are alot of options in strength depending on how much you want to illuminate and
        what style you want to give it, therefore there are <strong>no recommended strength on Garden lights</strong><br>.
        <strong>The recommended color is set to 1800k</strong>, to give it a cozy yellow glow.
